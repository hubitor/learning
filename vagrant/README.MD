# Vagrant
This folder contains files used to work with [Vagrant][1].

## Contents
**template:** Contains Vagrant template files used for creating new Vagrant environments for testing/learning. The idea of having a more generic Vagrantfile and using a YAML file with machine data in it to provision VM was inspired by [Scott Lowe's][2] [learning-tools repo][3].
**docker:** Contains Vagrant environment for running CentOS 7 VM locally with the Docker daemon exposed so that I can interact with it from Windows Subsystem for Linux.
