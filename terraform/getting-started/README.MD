# Terraform Getting Started
This directory contains the files generated from going through the [Terraform getting started guide][1] with a few modifications of my own to better understand how to manipulate things. It requires having Terraform installed and a valid AWS account.

The version of Terraform that was used for these examples was v0.10.2.
